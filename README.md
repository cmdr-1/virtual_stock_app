# virtual_stock_app
The final problem set for CS50. The goal was to create a virtual stock market app using an API to get stock prices and a SQL database to log registered users, 

The majority of the code written by me was done in the functions in application.py, as well as the template files (except for layout.html).
finance.db holds the 3 tables that I created to store relevant information for the web app.
